          <h3>ScriptEd In September</h3>
          <p>Today was a <em class="blank">&nbsp;</em> day at the BILA ScriptEd class. The sky was <em class="blank">&nbsp;</em> and the sun was shining brightly over Brooklyn.
          </p>
          <p>Class had just started when <em class="blank">&nbsp;</em> walked in the classroom door, and asked if anyone wanted to <em class="blank">&nbsp;</em>?
          </p>
          <p><em class="blank">&nbsp;
         </em> stood up and answered, "Ummm, maybe, but after we learn to code." So <em class="blank">&nbsp;</em> sat down to join the lesson. Everyone typed <em class="blank">&nbsp;</em> and <em class="blank">&nbsp;</em> into Popcode, and after the HTML rendered we had some awesome <em class="blank">&nbsp;</em>.
          </p>
          <p>Then everyone <em class="blank">&nbsp;</em>ed outside and <em class="blank">&nbsp;</em> ! It was a great day.</p>
